This is a compiler for the simple C language
It uses the following datatypes (all 8 bytes): long, long*, char*, char**, void


Typing 'make' in the main directory will build the compiler and link it as the executable 'scc' (for simple c compiler)

If you're in the 'tests' directory, running the 'testall' shell script will run all the tests the project is graded against.
